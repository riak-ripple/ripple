# The test environment has additional keys for configuring the
# Riak::TestServer for your test/spec suite:
#
# * bin_dir specifies the path to the "riak" script that you use to
#           start Riak (just the directory)
# * js_source_dir specifies where your custom Javascript functions for
#           MapReduce should be loaded from. Usually app/mapreduce.
test:
  port: 9000
  host: localhost
  bin_dir: /usr/local/bin   # Default for Homebrew.
  js_source_dir: <%%= Rails.root + "app/mapreduce" %>
