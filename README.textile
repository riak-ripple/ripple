h1. ripple

ripple is a Ruby client/wrapper for Riak, Basho's distributed database.

h2. Dependencies

ripple requires ActiveSupport >=2.3.  We highly recommend the "curb":http://curb.rubyforge.org/ gem for better HTTP client performance.

In development, you will also need these gems:

* jeweler
* rspec >= 1.2.9
* fakeweb >= 1.2
* curb >= 0.6
* rack >= 1.0
* yard >= 0.5.2

h2. Basic Example

<notextile><pre>require 'riak'

# Create a client interface
client = Riak::Client.new

# Retrieve a bucket
bucket = client.bucket("doc")  # a Riak::Bucket

# Get an object from the bucket
object = bucket.get("index.html")   # a Riak::RObject

# Change the object's data and save
object.data = "<html><body>Hello, world!</body></html>"
object.store

# Reload an object you already have
object.reload                  # Works if you have the key and vclock
object.reload :force => true   # Reloads whether you have the vclock or not

# Access more like a hash, client[bucket][key]
client['doc']['index.html']   # the Riak::RObject</pre></notextile>

h2. Map-Reduce Example

<notextile><pre>

# Assuming you've already instantiated a client, get the album titles for The Beatles
results = Riak::MapReduce.new(client).
                add("artists","Beatles").
                link(:bucket => "albums").
                map("function(v){ return [JSON.parse(v.values[0].data).title]; }").run

p results # => [["Please Please Me", "With The Beatles", "A Hard Day's Night", "Beatles For Sale", "Help!", "Rubber Soul", 
          #      "Revolver", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "The Beatles", "Yellow Submarine", "Abbey Road", "Let It Be"]]</pre></notextile>

h2. How to Contribute
 
* Fork the project on "Github":http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple.  If you have already forked, use @git pull --rebase@ to reapply your changes on top of the mainline. Example:
  <notextile><pre>$ git checkout master
$ git pull --rebase seancribbs master</pre></notextile>
* Create a topic branch. If you've already created a topic branch, rebase it on top of changes from the mainline "master" branch. Examples:
** New branch:
  <pre>$ git checkout -b topic</pre>
** Existing branch:
  <pre>$ git rebase master</pre>
* Write an RSpec example, set of examples, and/or Cucumber story that demonstrate the necessity and validity of your changes. *Patches without specs will most often be ignored. Just do it, you'll thank me later.*
* Make your feature addition or bug fix. Make your specs and stories pass (green).
* Run the suite using multiruby or rvm to ensure cross-version compatibility.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or VERSION.  If related to an existing issue in the "tracker":http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/issues, include "Closes #X" in the commit message (where X is the issue number).
