h1. riak-client

riak-client is a simple Ruby client/wrapper for Riak, Basho's distributed database.

h2. Dependencies

riak-client requires ActiveSupport >=2.3.  We highly recommend the "curb" gem for better HTTP client performance.

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.  If you have already forked, use @git pull --rebase@ to reapply your changes on top of the mainline. Example:
  <pre><notextile>$ git checkout master; git pull --rebase seancribbs master</notextile></pre>
* Create a topic branch. If you've already created a topic branch,
  rebase it on top of changes from the mainline "master"
  branch. Examples:
** New branch:
  <pre>$ git checkout -b topic</pre>
** Existing branch:
  <pre>$ git rebase master</pre>
* Write an RSpec example, set of examples, and/or Cucumber story that demonstrate the necessity and
  validity of your changes. *Patches without specs will most often be
  ignored. Just do it, you'll thank me later.*
* Make your feature addition or bug fix. Make your specs and stories pass (green).
* Run the suite using multiruby or rvm to ensure cross-version compatibility.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or VERSION.  If related to an existing issue in the tracker, include "Closes #X" in the commit message (where X is the issue number).
* Send me a pull request.
